### **SMARTboost Learning for Tabular Data**

Abstract: We introduce SMARTboost (boosting of symmetric smooth additive regression trees), a machine learning model capable of fitting complex functions in high dimensions, yet designed for good performance in small n and low signal-to-noise environments. SMARTboost inherits many of the qualities that have made boosted trees the most widely used machine learning tool for tabular data; it automatically adjusts model complexity, handles continuous and discrete features, can capture nonlinear functions in high dimensions without overfitting, performs variable selection, and can handle highly non-Gaussian features. The combination of smooth symmetric trees and carefully designed Bayesian priors gives SMARTboost an edge (in comparison with a state-of-the-art tool like XGBoost) in many settings with continuous and mixed discrete-continuous features. Unlike other tree-based methods, it can also compute marginal effects.\
